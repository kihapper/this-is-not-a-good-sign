###THIS IS NOT A GOOD SIGN

In this project we use augmented reality and live weather data to overlay the user's surroundings with signage posing questions about past and present climatic conditions. Why is the sky so blue? Has it always rained? These signs call attention to the small changes in the climate already occurring all around us, inviting playful responses.
